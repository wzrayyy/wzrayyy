My name is Arthur. I’m studying for a CS major and really love tech!

My main interest is in networking, but I do a little programming here and there. 💻

I know C++, Python, and I'm currently trying to learn Go. 🚀

I have a lot of experience administering Linux machines and know my way around network engineering. 🛠️

Feel free to check out the projects that I've worked on! 🌟
